# TryHackMe – OWASP Juice Shop Walkthrough Summary
## Overview
The OWASP Juice Shop room is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed to demonstrate common web security flaws listed in the OWASP Top 10. The exercise focuses on hands-on exploitation of real-world web vulnerabilities such as information disclosure, injection flaws, and broken authentication.
---
## Key Findings
### 1. Information Disclosure
•⁠  ⁠The application exposes sensitive information through normal user interactions (e.g., product reviews and search features).
•⁠  ⁠Administrator email addresses and internal references were discoverable without authentication.
### 2. Insecure Search Functionality
•⁠  ⁠The search feature uses a visible URL parameter (⁠ q ⁠) that can be observed and analyzed.
•⁠  ⁠This allows attackers to understand backend query behavior and identify potential injection points.
### 3. Broken Authentication
•⁠  ⁠The login mechanism is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
•⁠  ⁠Improper input validation allows attackers to bypass authentication using crafted input such as logical conditions that always evaluate to true.
### 4. SQL Injection Vulnerability
•⁠  ⁠The application fails to properly sanitize user input in login forms.
•⁠  ⁠Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to authenticate as other users, including administrators.
---
## Security Impact
•⁠  ⁠*Unauthorized Access:* Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to privileged accounts.
•⁠  ⁠*Data Breach Risk:* Sensitive user and system data can be exposed or extracted from the database.
•⁠  ⁠*Privilege Escalation:* Gaining admin-level access allows full control over application functionality.
•⁠  ⁠*Reputation Damage:* Exploitation of such vulnerabilities can severely damage user trust and organizational credibility.
•⁠  ⁠*System Integrity Threats:* Attackers may modify or delete database records, causing permanent data loss or corruption.

## Remediation Recommendations
### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
•⁠  ⁠Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs.
•⁠  ⁠Use allowlists where possible instead of blocklists.
### 2. Use Parameterized Queries
•⁠  ⁠Replace dynamic SQL queries with prepared statements.
•⁠  ⁠This prevents SQL code injection by treating input as data only.
### 3. Secure Authentication Mechanisms
•⁠  ⁠Implement strong authentication logic using secure frameworks.
•⁠  ⁠Avoid directly embedding user input into database queries.
### 4. Error Handling Improvements
•⁠  ⁠Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users.
•⁠  ⁠Use generic error responses to prevent information leakage.
### 5. Security Testing
•⁠  ⁠Regularly perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
•⁠  ⁠Include automated SAST/DAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Conclusion
The Juice Shop lab demonstrates how small implementation mistakes can lead to critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and broken authentication. Proper input handling, secure coding practices, and continuous security testing are essential to mitigate these risks in real-world applications.
